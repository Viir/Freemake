## Backlog

+ Make walking easier: Support walking also by clicking nodes which appear reachable in the current game state. If multiple paths are possible to reach the node, let the character take the shortest path.
+ Create a denser atmosphere: Add acoustic support, sounds suiting the current location (Different between desert surface and cave).
+ Integrate nicer visuals: Improve readability of or variety in the cave.
+ Use less abrupt visual transition for locally offered actions when the player moves. (At the moment, the location-specific text changes instantly without smooth transition).
